Given historical electricity consumption data, the goal is to forecast short-term energy demand and detect anomalous consumption patterns that may indicate abnormal behavior or system issues.

Who would use a script like this?

A grid operator or someone who wants to know abnormalities and problems with energy supply. Potentially a customer who would like to know when or even where peak power usage is. Foreign agents might be interested also. 

Decision support? 

The script should be able highlight when peaks might be expected in advance. Ideally with capability for both human response, and also mechanical decision making

Forecast horizon? 

Can this code predict over the next 24 hours energy useage given historical movement. 

Granularity? 

Training data with hourly resolution suggests only hourly data predictions. 

What is an anomaly? 

If forecasts and actual useage do not match, then an anomaly is probable. Backward analysis would then be suggested for nderstanding and updating the model.
